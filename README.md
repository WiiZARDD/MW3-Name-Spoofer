# Getting Started
    
`Open .sln with Visual Studio 2019`

`Compile batch build x86 to create .EXE`
		
`Launch Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (iw5mp.exe)`
		
`Run .EXE as administrator`

		
# Background
    
Colored names will NOT WORK with this tool because color codes in MW3 were patched a while ago! With MW3 Name Spoofer you can change your in-game name without having to change your steam name! Stay completely HIDDEN FROM REPORTS :) -LUCIFER

# Updates

- User Interface Updates
- New Classes
- Updated for MW3 1.9.388110!
    
# Not Working?
    
Make sure you launch "MW3 Name Spoofer.exe" as soon as MW3 launches and you see the logo appear.
    
# FYI

- For brain dead skids saying this is dEtEctEd, it will never be so please go back to bed.
    
- If it isn't working for you, you're either retarded or doing something wrong, because it works.
